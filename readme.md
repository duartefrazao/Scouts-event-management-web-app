A scouts event management web app that allows scouts to create groups at a local, regional and national level.
Features a complex system of authorization policies, some examples:
- Groups of users that can be invited as a whole
- A young scout might need a responsible parent to also create an account to manage the activity of the son.
- When young scouts come of age they need to be granted privileges to use the site fully
- Scouts need to be moved between groups where they might have different levels of authorization (comment, respond, edit...)

A chat system is available for scout users to comment and plan the events.

A voting system to choose what is the best available date was also created.

All the scout structure is included in each organization (each local group has 4 section groups depending on the age and every year chiefs decide in the group management which scouts proceed)

Email capabilities also included to allow communication from the events and invitations.
